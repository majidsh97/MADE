## Title

Analysis of International Student Preferences: Canada vs. USA

## Main Question

Do students from certain countries prefer Canada over the USA as a study destination in recent years?

## Description

This project explores trends in international student demographics, aiming to determine if there has been a shift in preference for studying in Canada instead of the USA among students from various countries. By analyzing data on international students in Canada and comparing it with broader international student demographics. This analysis will involve constructing ETL pipelines to clean, transform, and analyze the data.

## Work Packages

1. **Data Collection and Initial Analysis**  
    - [Issue #1](https://github.com/your-repository/issues/1): Load, examine, and clean datasets on international students in Canada and global student demographics to assess data quality and coverage.

2. **ETL Pipeline Development**  
    - [Issue #2](https://github.com/your-repository/issues/2): Design and implement ETL pipelines to transform and integrate both datasets into a cohesive format for comparative analysis.

3. **Data Integration and Knowledge Graph Construction**  
    - [Issue #3](https://github.com/your-repository/issues/3): Create a knowledge graph or relational data structure to link country-wise data on student preferences across Canada and the USA.

4. **Trend Analysis and Hypothesis Testing**  
    - [Issue #4](https://github.com/your-repository/issues/4): Use statistical methods and trend analysis to identify any shift in student preferences from various countries toward Canada over the USA.

5. **Visualization and Insights Generation**  
    - [Issue #5](https://github.com/your-repository/issues/5): Develop visualizations and summary insights to illustrate findings, showing trends in country-wise student preferences.

6. **Project Documentation and Final Review**  
    - [Issue #6](https://github.com/your-repository/issues/6): Ensure all aspects of the project are well-documented, and findings are organized for clear presentation.

This project plan will be updated as needed throughout the semester.
